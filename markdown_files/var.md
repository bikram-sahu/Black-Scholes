## Variance-Covariance approach

The Variance-covariance is a parametric method which assumes that the returns are
normally distributed. In this method, we first calculate the mean and standard deviation of
the returns. For $95 \%$ confidence level, VaR is calculated as mean $-1.65^{\star}$ standard
deviation and for $99 \%$ confidence level, VaR is calculated as $-2.33^{*}$ standard deviation.
