# The Black-Scholes option pricing formula for European options.

*The project is aimed at building intuition on Option Pricing and how it depends on various parameters. The plots come with interactive widgets.*

This contains:

  1. Analytical solution of Black-Scholes equation and sensitivity analysis of Option price to different parameters.
  2. Option Greeks: Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta
    * Plots of how these Greeks for call options varies with Time-to-Maturity.
  3. Numerical Solution to Balck-Scholes
	  * Monte Carlo
	  * Finite Difference
  4. Volatility Surface
  5. Delta Hedging
  6. Value at Risk (VaR)
